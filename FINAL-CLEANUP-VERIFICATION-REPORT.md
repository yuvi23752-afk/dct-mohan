# DCT CRM Final Cleanup and Verification

**Audit date:** 2026-09-28  
**Disposition:** **PARTIAL — the identified homepage API/runtime defect is fixed and the verified checks pass; this is not full production release sign-off.**

This report records the latest cleanup and runtime verification. It supersedes earlier statements about runtime and database verification in [FINAL-RELEASE-AUDIT-REPORT.md](./FINAL-RELEASE-AUDIT-REPORT.md). The worktree already contained extensive changes before this audit; unrelated and uncertain files were preserved.

## Findings fixed

The authenticated homepage API initially failed because the Prisma schema did not match the local PostgreSQL schema:

1. `Dashboard.homepagesProfileId`, its `profile` relation, and its index were not present in the database. They were redundant with the explicit `DashboardProfileShare` relation and have been removed from `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. The database's `DashboardProfileShare` table contains only `id`, `dashboardId`, and `profileId`. The Prisma-only `createdAt` field has been removed from that model.
3. The related, unapplied `packages/db/migrations/add_homepage_profile_sharing.sql` no longer adds the unused `homepagesProfileId` column/index or an unrepresented `createdAt` column.

No migration, schema push, or database DDL was run. Prisma Client was regenerated locally after stopping the audit-started processes that held its engine file.

## Verification performed

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Prisma schema validation | **PASS** |
| Prisma Client generation | **PASS** |
| `npm test` | **PASS** — API: 6 files / 36 tests; web: 5 files / 10 tests; 46 tests total |
| `npm run typecheck` | **PASS** — API, web, database, and shared workspaces |
| `npm run lint` | **PASS with existing warnings** |
| `npm run build` | **PASS** — API compiled and Next.js generated all 45 static pages |
| `npm ls --depth=0` | **PASS** — no missing or invalid top-level workspace dependencies |
| `git diff --check` | **PASS** — only line-ending conversion warnings |
| `npm run start --workspace=apps/api` | **PASS** — revised production start command served the API |
| API health endpoint | **PASS** — HTTP 200 |
| Unauthenticated homepage API request | **PASS** — HTTP 401 |
| Authenticated `/api/homepages` | **PASS** — HTTP 200, successful response |
| Authenticated `/api/homepages/assigned` | **PASS** — HTTP 200, successful response; no dashboard was assigned to the current profile |
| Authenticated `/home` browser smoke check | **PASS** — dashboard rendered with live KPI and activity data |
| Read-only database metadata query | **PASS** — confirmed the three existing `DashboardProfileShare` columns above |

The API and web processes started for runtime checks were stopped afterward. The AI process had already been stopped after its earlier health/authentication check.

## Cleanup decisions

### Removed as confirmed temporary/generated

- Two standalone probe/check scripts with no production or suite references.
- Twenty-four stale log files.
- Two generated Python bytecode files and their now-empty generated-data folders.

No business source, assertion-based test suite, required migration, seed script, or uncertain file was removed.

### Keep

- Business source, application routes, migrations, seed files, and regression tests.
- The explicit `DashboardProfileShare` many-to-many relation, which matches the inspected database shape.

### Review before any broader cleanup

- Numerous pre-existing modified and untracked files remain in the worktree. Their ownership and intent could not be established by this audit; preserve them until reviewed with their author.
- The lockfile-only npm operation reported 15 dependency advisories (including one critical). No automatic audit fix was applied; review compatibility and remediation before release.
- Existing lint warnings and React test `act()` warnings remain.
- The historical [POST-MERGE-AUDIT-REPORT.md](./POST-MERGE-AUDIT-REPORT.md) includes findings that were not revalidated as part of this runtime fix.

## Remaining verification and release risks

- Only the homepage GET paths and general dashboard rendering were exercised against the local database. Homepage create/update/status flows and the broader business workflows, permission matrix, tenant isolation, and data-integrity scenarios were not fully tested.
- No production database migration or deployment procedure was tested. Before applying the edited migration elsewhere, verify the target schema and migration history, take the normal backup, and follow the deployment process.
- The successful authenticated browser session updated `User.lastLoginAt` as normal login behavior. No other business records were intentionally modified.
- Full browser/E2E coverage, AI runtime verification, and a complete dependency/security remediation review remain outstanding.

**Final disposition: PARTIAL.** The reported homepage 500s are resolved against the inspected local database, and the build, tests, typechecks, and targeted runtime checks pass. This report does not certify every production workflow or security boundary.
